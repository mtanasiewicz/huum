# Dislaimer
Due to a stall on the original [frwickst/huum-integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72674) repo, I decided
to clone the code and proceed with HACS. This repository is made only for my personal use, so use it on your own risk.
All the credits to @frwickst for providing this integration, I have only implemented suggestions from the PR and ported
it to be usable via HACS.
